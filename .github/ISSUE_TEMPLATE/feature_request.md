## üåü Feature Description

A clear and concise description of the feature you're proposing. Include:
- What component it would affect (quantum hypercube, topology engine, consensus mechanism, etc.)
- How it relates to quantum-topological security principles
- Whether it enhances TVI calculation, adaptive dimension expansion, or WDM parallelism

## üéØ Motivation and Use Cases

Explain **why** this feature is needed:
- What problem does it solve? (e.g., "Current TVI calculation doesn't account for quantum drift in high-dimensional spaces")
- What use cases would benefit from this feature?
- How does it align with the core philosophy: "Topology isn't a hacking tool, but a microscope for diagnosing vulnerabilities"?

## üìà Expected Benefits

Quantify the expected improvements (if possible):
- Performance: Expected speedup in signature verification/nonce search (e.g., "+X%")
- Security: Expected reduction in TVI for vulnerable wallets (e.g., "Reduce false negatives by X%")
- Resource usage: Expected reduction in memory/energy consumption
- Migration impact: How it affects the transition from classical to post-quantum algorithms

## üß© Proposed Implementation

Outline how you envision the feature could be implemented:
```python
# Example code or pseudo-code if applicable
def new_feature():
    """Description of the new functionality"""
    # Implementation details
    return quantum_topology.calculate_enhanced_tvi()
```
