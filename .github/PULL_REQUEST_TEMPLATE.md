*Note: QuantumFortress 2.0 targets minimum 4.5x speedup in both signature verification and nonce search through WDM parallelism*

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Implications

Analyze security implications:
- Does this change affect TVI calculation or interpretation? [Yes/No]
  - If yes, explain how: _______________
- Does this impact quantum resistance? [Yes/No]
